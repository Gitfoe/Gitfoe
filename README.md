### 👋 Hi, I’m @Gitfoe or also known as Wafoe. My name's Julian and I'm from the Netherlands.
📚 I'm a Disciplined  student HBO-ICT and graduated MBO ICT administrator with a broad field of interest. I have had a passion for computer systems since 2010 and it has only grown over the years. I have knowledge of IT infrastructure design and security, software development, IT business management and data science. My goal is to secure and keep safe the ever-expanding online world. I also own my own film company.
🖖 I like to split my daily activities into work-related skills and personal hobbies.
* 🖥️ Within my IT engineering/science bachelor’s, I have an interest in security, forensics, software development, business management, data science, and infrastructure/network design. You could say that I am broadly oriented in IT and enjoy many different aspects of it.
* 📷 Outside my study, I am a self-employed video producer and love to do anything video, photo, and audio production-related. For instance, I have gathered quite a big following on YouTube, consisting of mostly technology-related informational videos, gaming content, and humour.
* ⚽ For pastime activities, you will usually see me enjoying nature, working out, playing a game, or learning a miscellaneous skill. I am quite open to new experiences, so my daily activities and hobbies will vary from time to time. Currently, I am focussing on professional photography and learning the piano.
